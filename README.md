Application Software Security Engineering
====

My submission for an assignment to Bond University's ASSE subject. The assignment was to develop a 'smart meter' for electricity 
and to apply application security principles by securing against the [OWASP][1] top 20 vulnerablity list. 

No assignment documentation is provided here, only Java code.
